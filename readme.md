# JSON parser in OCaml

![CI@trunk](https://github.com/alessandro90/OCaml_json_parser/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A very simple json parser in OCaml. Not fully complete or particularly efficient. It is just an exercise to familiarize with the language.

To run the main executable:

```bash
dune exec json
```

To run the test suite:

```bash
dune test
```
